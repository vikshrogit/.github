We are strive to understand the importance of the software we're going to create. We will go ahead and design and develop the software to meet the criteria they identified and the users' needs. The products they work on may include desktop solutions, mobile applications, SaaS products, and more.

Security of data at rest and data at transport is one of the basic security requirements to consider when developing software. Cryptography is the art/science of Secret writing. The goal is to keep information from those who aren't supposed to see it by "scrambling" the original data. We use a well-known algorithm to scramble data. The cryptographic algorithms have two inputs as data & key. The key is known only to authorized users. Encryptions and Hashing are two main parts of cryptography.
